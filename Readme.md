# Reproducing "Learning to Pivot" paper with PyTorch

Trying to reproduce the results from the "Learning to Pivot" paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01046


# Authors Code

The authors code using Keras can be found here :
https://github.com/glouppe/paper-learning-to-pivot/


# TODO

Use a mixture density network with 5 gaussians like in the notebook :
